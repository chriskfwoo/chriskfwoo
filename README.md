### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Sometimes, my friends call me **Woooooooooooo** or **Woozzie**.

I graduated from Concordia University in Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering and completed my quest to get the engineering iron ring. 
I also helped organize ConUHacks IV and V, the biggest hackathon in Montreal at Concordia University.

I'm currently a Software Engineer @ [DRW](https://drw.com/)
